<h3><a id="getting_started_with_the_software" class="anchor" href="#getting_started_with_the_software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started with the software</h3>
<p>AERobot is a programmable robot. This means that you can create or own apps for it with, using a graphical programming environment called miniBloq. You can download the last version of miniBloq from <a href="http://blog.minibloq.org/p/download.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded it, just run the installer <b>miniBloq.v0.83.exe</b> (Windows&#174; is currently required; we're working to extend to other operating systems.)</p>

<h3><a id="Installing_the_drivers_Windows_7)" class="anchor" href="#Installing_the_drivers_Windows_7" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing the drivers under Windows&#174; 7</h3>
<p>AERobot's drivers are deployed with miniBloq. So you don't need to download aditional software. Just press the button <b>Open folder with drivers</b> on the Hardware window:</p>
<p><img src="images/miniBloq_drivers0.png" alt="Drivers" width="393"></p>
<p>There you will find folders <b>win7</b> and <b>win8</b>, where you can select the drivers for your current operating system. Now please connect your robot to any USB port and open the <b>win7</b> folder and then the <b>bin</b> folder inside it (please also note that if you have more than one robot, only one can be plugged on the same computer.) Now run the <b>inf-wizard.exe</b> program:</p>
<p><img src="images/usbWizard.png" alt="Drivers" width="472"></p>
<p>With the robot connected, press the <b>Next</b> button and then select the device that says <b>USBasp</b> on its <b>Description</b> field:</p>
<p><img src="images/usbWizard1.png" alt="Drivers" width="473"></p>
<p>Press <b>Next</b> again twice and the wizard will ask you to save the automatically generated .inf file. Just save it anywhere on your computer and press the <b>Instal Now...</b> button:</p>
<p><img src="images/usbWizard2.png" alt="Drivers" width="473"></p>
<p>If you want to be sure that your robot is recognized by the operating system, you can always go to <b>Control Panel->System</b> and there to the <b>Device Manager</b> (on the upper left corner of the screen). Under the <b>libusb-win32 devices</b> category, you should see the <b>USBasp</b> entry, without any exlamation mark or yellow sign there:</p>

<p>Coming soon...</p>

<h3><a id="robot_calibration" class="anchor" href="#robot_calibration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Robot calibration</h3>
<p>In order to get AREobot properly working it's <b>very important to calibrate its motors and its line sensors</b>. Also, everytime that you change the surface where the robot is going to move over, doing again the motor calibration may be necessary (only if you note that your robot is not moving nicely.)</p>
<p>To calibrate the robot just go to miniBloq's menu <b>View->Properties</b> (or press <b>Alt+p</b>.) Once the <b>Properties</b> window is open, please select the <b>AERobot</b> tab:</p>
<p><img src="images/miniBloq_calibration1.png" alt="calibration screen" width="381"></p>
<p>The first thing to be calibrated is the <b>Forward movement</b> of the robot. In order to do so, please follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the robot to the USB port.</li>
<li>Press the <b>Forward Clear</b> button. This will upload the clear program to the robot, so you should see the following message after successful uploading:</li>
<p><img src="images/calibration_forwardClear.png" alt="robot picker" width="626"></p>
If you don't see this screen, try reseting the robot and pressing the <b>Forward Clear</b>button again (Note: in some computers it could be necessary to press the button more than one or two times.)
<li>Unplug the robot from the USB port. You will see the RGB LED in green color.</li>
<li>Plug the robot again to the USB port.</li>
<li>Now press the <b>Forward</b> button until you get the successful upload message on the screen.</li>
<li>Unplug the robot and put it over the surface where you want to calibrate it. If it does not start to move, press its reset button.</li>
<li>The robot will start moving slowly, and probably it will not advance straight. The whole idea about calibration is to get it moving as straight and as fast as possible on the given surface. In order to do that, you will need to indicate if one of the motors needs to move a bit faster. This can be done by activating the distance sensor on the side of the motor that you want to accelerate. Each time you activate one of the sensors, you will see how the robot accelerates the motor on that sice, and also the LED will blink so you know that the sensor was activated. The following video shows the procdure clearer:</li>
</ol>
<p>Videos, and more information about calibration coming soon...</p>

<h3><a id="programing_the_robot" class="anchor" href="#programing_the_robot" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programing the robot</h3>
<p>One of the simplest tasks that we can make AERobot to do is just moving. So let's program the robot to rotate clockwise indefinetely, which requires just one instruction (or <b>block</b> in miniBloq.) Please open miniBloq and from the actions picker on the right of the screen, click on the block with the robot icon:</p>
<p><img src="images/actions_picker.png" alt="actions picker" width="157"></p>
<p>Now, on the block that has been created, just click on the red button to select the action to be done by the robot. There click on one of the rotation actions:</p>
<p><img src="images/robot_picker.png" alt="robot picker" width="582"></p>
<p>Once you have your program ready, and with the robot plugged in the USB port, just press the Run button (green arrow on the top toolbox) or the <b>Ctrl+U</b> keys. A black message window will pop-up on the bottom of the screen. If the robot was sucessuflly programed, you will see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/minibloq_messages_ok.png" alt="minibloq messages ok" width="582"></p>
<p>If you see red text instead, or any error message, try pressing the robot's reset button while keeping the robot plugged into the USB port, and try again. Sometimes this operation may take 2 or 3 tries.</p>
<p>Once miniBloq tells you that the robot has been successfully programmed, unplug the robot, flip it so its acrylic part touches the table and see how it moves. If it does not start to move, just press it's reset button. It's worth noting that everytime that a program runs on AERobot, it first <b>blinks 3 times its RGB LED in blue color</b>.</p>

<!--
<p>On this page, you can learn about downloading and installing the software for AERobot, calibrating the sensors and motors, and programming the robot.</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>Visit the <a href="http://blog.minibloq.org/p/download.html">download page</a> at <a href="minibloq.org">miniBloq.org</a> and download the installer from the link near the top of the page. <i>(Only Windows is supported at this time. We're working on extending support to other operating systems.)</i></p>

Soon you'll be able to read here about downloading and installing the software for AERobot, calibrating the sensors and motors, and programming the robot. In the meantime, you can visit <a href="minibloq.org">miniBloq.org</a> for a head start; the software is all at the main download link you'll find there, soon to be supplemented by step-by-step instructions here.
